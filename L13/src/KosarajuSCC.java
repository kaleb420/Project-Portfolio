/**
 * Lab 13 Starter Code:
 * Recursive DFS Applications – Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's Algorithm).
 * .
 * High-level idea:
 *   .
 *   We work on a directed graph G with vertices 0..n-1.
 *   .
 *   PASS 1 (on original graph):
 *     - Run DFS from every vertex that has not yet been visited.
 *     - When a vertex finishes (we exit its DFS call), we push it onto a stack.
 *   .
 *   PASS 2 (on the transpose graph G^T):
 *     - Process vertices in the reverse order of their finish times
 *       (by popping from the stack).
 *     - For each vertex popped that has not yet been visited in this pass,
 *       run a DFS in the transpose graph; all vertices reached in this DFS
 *       form one strongly connected component.
